## Description

Scratch utilizes the ExchangeRate-API for currency conversion. Users can enter any US dollar amount (integers only) and receive the exchange rate of nearly any currency by inputting the necessary currency code. 
<br>
Currently, the North Korean Won (KPW) is unsupported. The following currencies experience heightened volatility & substantial differences between actual rates of exchange available in different markets and those published officially: 

* Libyan Dinar (LYD), Libya
* South Sudanese Pound (SSP), South Sudan
* Syrian Pound (SYP), Syria
* Venezuelan Bol√≠var Soberano (VES), Venezuela
* Yemeni Rial (YER), Yemen

### API Security  
* Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of the project.***

  ![.env Example](src/assets/images/env-example.png)

***A ```.env``` file along with the ```dotenv-webpack``` will keep your API key secure. [Read more about API key security](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/asynchrony-and-apis/managing-api-keys).
